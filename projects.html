    <p class="p">This is my performence task. This project was for my APCSP class. The task was to implment coding skills we learned throughout the year to make a program that was interesting. Completing this project entailed coding different functions that would teach the person running the program about zoo animals. During this project I got to practice my coding skills and learn about the diets and habitats of zoo animals. </p>

    <p class="p">This is an image of my rhetorical anlysis lesson. This assigment was for my english class this year. For this project, we were assigned a topic to teach the class about. With my group I designed visually appealing slides to refresh the class on the skill of rhetorical analysis. We selected text from the book Their Eyes Were Watching God for the class to anaylze. I learned about the specific choices the author made in Their Eyes Were Watching God to effect the reader. </p>
