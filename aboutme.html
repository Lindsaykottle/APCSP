    <p class="p">Hi, I'm Lindsay Kottle. I am a junior at Piedmont High School. I was born in San Francisco and I now live in Piedmont, California. In my free time I enjoy playing lacrosse and spending time with friends. I live with my mom, dad, sister and two dogs. I also enjoy hiking with my dogs and spending time outdoors.</p>
